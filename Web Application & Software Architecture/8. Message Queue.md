## What Is A Message Queue? (FIFO) 
   - It routes messages from the source to the destination or we can say from the sender to the receiver.
   - Feature:
     - Stores data in RAM
     - It is no definite size, infinite buffer
     - Facilitate asynchronous behaviour
     - Cross-module communication
    
## Publish Subscribe Model
   - A Publish-Subscribe model is the model where multiple consumers receive the same message sent from a single or multiple producers.
## Exchanges
   - It further push the messages to the queues based on the exchange type and the rules which are set.
   - Types: direct, topic, headers, fanout. [detail](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html)

## Point to Point Model
  - Itâ€™s not a broadcast of messages rather an entity to entity communication.

## Messaging Protocols
  - **AMQP** Advanced Message Queue Protocol & **STOMP** Simple or Streaming Text Oriented Message Protocol.
  - queuing tech: RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka etc.
  
## Notification Systems & Real-time Feeds with Message Queues
  - Pull-Based Approach
    - downside:
        - consume a lot of bandwidth & will also put a lot of unnecessary load on the database.
        - Post will not be real-time.

  - Push-Based Approach
    - it will have a distributed transaction
        - One transaction will update the database.
        - The other transaction will send the post payload to the message queue.

## Handling Concurrent Requests With Message Queues
  - use a message queue to manage a high number of concurrent requests to update an entity.
