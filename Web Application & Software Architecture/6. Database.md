  - Data Strong Consistency
  - ACID Transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity, Durability.
    - An acid transaction means if a transaction in a system occurs, say a financial transaction, either it will be executed with perfection without affecting any other processes or transactions.
    
# No Relarionship DB
  - they are more like JSON-based databases built for Web 2.0. MongoDB, Redis, Neo4J, Cassandra
  - Scalability
  - Clustering
  - Flexibility With Data Modeling
  - Eventual Consistency
  - Handling A Large Number Of Read Write Operations
  - Data Analysis
  
  
# Using Both SQL & NoSQL Database In An Application
  - Polyglot persistence
    - Polyglot persistence means using several different persistence technologies to fulfil different persistence requirements in an application
    
  - Multi-model databases
    - It support multiple data models like Graph, Document-Oriented, Relational etc. as opposed to supporting only one data model.
