# Relational Database
  - SQL is the primary data query language used to interact with relational databases.
  - Data Strong Consistency
  - ACID Transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity, Durability.
    - An acid transaction means if a transaction in a system occurs, say a financial transaction, either it will be executed with perfection without affecting any other processes or transactions.
    
# No Relarionship DB
  - they are more like JSON-based databases built for Web 2.0. MongoDB, Redis, Neo4J, Cassandra
  - Scalability
  - Clustering
  - Flexibility With Data Modeling
  - Eventual Consistency
  - Handling A Large Number Of Read Write Operations
  - Data Analysis
  
  
# Using Both SQL & NoSQL Database In An Application
  - Polyglot persistence
    - Polyglot persistence means using several different persistence technologies to fulfil different persistence requirements in an application
    
  - Multi-model databases
    - It support multiple data models like Graph, Document-Oriented, Relational etc. as opposed to supporting only one data model.
    - popular multi-model databases are Arango DB, Cosmos DB, Orient DB, Couchbase etc.

# Eventual Consistency & Strong Consistency
  - Eventual consistency is a consistency model which enables the data store to be highly available.
    - Example:
      - the new updated value of the Post “Like” counter needs some time to move from Japan to America and update the server nodes running there. But when he refreshes his web page after a few seconds the “Like” counter value shows as 101.

  - Strong Consistency simply means the data has to be strongly consistent at all times.
    - the only way to implement this behaviour is by locking down the nodes when being updated.
    - Example:
      - So, once the user in Japan updates the “Like” counter from 100 to 101. The value gets replicated globally across all nodes. Once all the nodes reach a consensus, the locks get lifted.
