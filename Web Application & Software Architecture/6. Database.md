# Types of Database
  - NoSQL
    - Document-Oriented database
      - They store data in a document-oriented model in independent documents. The data is generally semi-structured & stored in a JSON-like format.
      - need a flexible schema which would change often.
      - Real-time feeds, Live sports apps, Writing product catalogues, Inventory management, Storing user comments, Web-based multiplayer games
      - MongoDB, CouchDB, OrientDB, Google Cloud Datastore, Amazon Document DB
    - Key-value datastore
      - use a simple key-value method to store and quickly fetch the data with minimum latency.
      - implement caching in applications due to the minimum latency they ensure.
      - need to fetch data real fast with minimum fuss & backend processing
      - Redis, Hazelcast, Riak, Voldemort & Memcache
    - Wide-column database
      - used to handle massive amounts of data, technically called the Big Data.
      - manage big data ensuring scalability, performance & high availability at the same time
      - need to grapple with Big data, to ingest it or to run analytics on it.
      - Cassandra, HBase, Google BigTable, Scylla DB etc.
    - Graph database
      - They store data in nodes/vertices and edges in the form of relationships
      - help us visualize our data with minimum latency
      - Graph databases are faster as the relationships in them are not calculated at the query time
      - need to building social, knowledge, network graphs. Writing AI-based apps, recommendation engines, fraud analysis app, storing genetic data etc.
      - Neo4J  example: Google Maps
    - Time-Series database
      - optimized for tracking & persisting time series data.
      - ingested from IoT devices, self-driving vehicles, industry sensors, social networks, stock market financial data etc.
      - need to manage data in real-time & continually over a long period of time
      - Influx DB, Timescale DB, Prometheus etc.
    - Databases dedicated to mobile apps
  - SQL
    - Relational database


# Relational Database
  - SQL is the primary data query language used to interact with relational databases. Mysql
  - Data Strong Consistency
  - ACID Transactions: Atomicity, Consistency, Integrity, Durability.
    - An acid transaction means if a transaction in a system occurs, say a financial transaction, either it will be executed with perfection without affecting any other processes or transactions.
    
# No Relational Database
  - they are more like JSON-based databases built for Web 2.0. MongoDB, Redis, Neo4J, Cassandra
  - Scalability
  - Clustering
  - Flexibility With Data Modeling
  - Eventual Consistency
  - Handling A Large Number Of Read Write Operations
  - Data Analysis
  
  
# Using Both SQL & NoSQL Database In An Application
  - Polyglot persistence
    - Polyglot persistence means using several different persistence technologies to fulfil different persistence requirements in an application
    - Downside is increased complexity in making all these different technologies work together.

  - Multi-model databases
    - It support multiple data models like Graph, Document-Oriented, Relational etc. as opposed to supporting only one data model.
    - Multi-model databases reduce the operational complexity of using several different database models in an application by supporting multiple data models via a single API.
    - popular multi-model databases are Arango DB, Cosmos DB, Orient DB, Couchbase etc.

# Eventual Consistency & Strong Consistency
  - Eventual consistency is a consistency model which enables the data store to be highly available.
    - Example:
      - the new updated value of the Post “Like” counter needs some time to move from Japan to America and update the server nodes running there. But when he refreshes his web page after a few seconds the “Like” counter value shows as 101.

  - Strong Consistency simply means the data has to be strongly consistent at all times.
    - the only way to implement this behaviour is by locking down the nodes when being updated.
    - Example:
      - So, once the user in Japan updates the “Like” counter from 100 to 101. The value gets replicated globally across all nodes. Once all the nodes reach a consensus, the locks get lifted.

# CAP Theorem
  - CAP stands for Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance(Fault Tolerance). 
  - A distributed database system can only have 2 of the 3: Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance.
