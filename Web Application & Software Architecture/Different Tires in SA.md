## Single Tire Applications
   - A single-tier application is an application where the user interface, backend business logic & the database all reside in the same machine.
   - Example: MS office
## Two Tier Applications
   - A Two-tier application involves a client and a server. The client would contain the user interface & the business logic in one machine. And the backend server would be the database running on a different machine. The database server is hosted by the business & has control over it.
   - Example: online browser & app-based games
## Three Tier Applications
   - In a three-tier application the user interface, application logic & the database all lie on different machines & thus have different tiers. They are physically separated.
   - Example: blog
## N Tier Applications
   - An N-tier application is an application which has more than three components involved.
   - Example: Instagram, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb
   - Why?
      - Single Responsibility Principle & Separation Of Concerns
      
## Layers and Tires
   - The layers mentioned in the illustration are at the code level. The difference between layers and tiers is that the layers represent the organization of the code and breaking it into components. Whereas, tiers involve physical separation of components.
