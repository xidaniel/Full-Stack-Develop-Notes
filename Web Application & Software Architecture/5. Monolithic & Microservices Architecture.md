# What Is A Monolithic Architecture?
  - An application has a monolithic architecture if it contains the entire application code in a single codebase.
  - In a monolithic web-app all the different layers of the app, UI, business, data access etc. are in the same codebase.
  - unlike the microservices architecture
  
  
# What Is A Microservices Architecture?
  - In a microservices architecture, different features/tasks are split into separate respective modules/codebases which work in conjunction with each other forming a large service as a whole.
  - Single Responsibility & the Separation of Concerns principles
  
# How to chose?
  - Monolithic applications fit best for use cases where the requirements are pretty simple, the app is expected to handle a limited amount of traffic.
  - Mcroservice architecture fits best for complex use cases and for apps which expect traffic to increase exponentially in future like a fancy social network application.
  - keep things simple, have a thorough understanding of the requirements.
